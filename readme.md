### Project Description
Eventify helps users plan events by connecting them with service providers. It supports easy budget tracking and customized contributions. The built-in chatbot guides users through the process, and payments are made through the app, held until service completion, ensuring trust¬†and¬†security.
### The Problem statement
Finding the right vendors and sponsors for an event is a mess.Organizers have to make endless calls, search through personal contacts, and negotiate prices manually. Vendors, on the other hand, struggle to find events to offer their services.

### The Solution
A one-stop AI-powered event marketplace! Organizers post their needs, vendors offer services, and our chatbot assists in finding the best matches‚Äîmaking event planning fast, hassle-free, and fun!
